# EE-271-Lab2

Task 1 - Design and build a circuit that functions as follows:

         1. Using as few gates as possible (NOR, INV, NAND), design a circuit where the LED lights up if
            the binary equivalent of the last digit of your student ID is inputted using the switches
         2. Write the verilog code for a circuit that will recognize the last TWO digits of your ID using 
            SW[3-0] as the last digit and SW[7-4] as the second to last digit.
